# How to Use

Main Files

Hashing.cpp is the main file that drives the program.

Audio Files

.wav files are included for sound effects and are compatible with Dev-C++. Compatibility with other IDEs, such as Visual Studio, is not guaranteed. 

Setup Instructions

Download Hashing.cpp and the .wav files to your system. Ensure the .wav files are placed in a directory of your choice and update the file paths in the code. 
For example: PlaySound(TEXT("C:/Users/PC/Downloads/User.wav"), NULL, SND_FILENAME | SND_SYNC); Replace the file path with the location of the .wav file on your system. Placing them in the Downloads folder will minimize changes. 

Configuring Sound in Dev-C++

To enable sound functionality in Dev-C++, follow these steps: Go to Tools > Compiler Options. Add -lwinmm to the linker commands.
